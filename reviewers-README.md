Hi everyone,

First off, thank you for the good feedback you all provided on the first third of the book! We've tried to incorporate most of the suggestions and bug reports into the version you now have in front of you, with a couple exceptions:

* We haven't done much with chapter 2. Based on the feedback we've gotten and our thinking about the chapter, we're considering doing more substantive edits, so we're holding off on making any fixes or tweaks to it for now.
* We've also left chapter 5 alone for now. We are going to be making a significant change to the representation of streams, which will affect a lot of the exercises. We are also going to be expanding the discussion of corecursion, which is just mentioned in passing in the chapter right now. 
* The preface we also left alone for now. We will probably revise that at the end, once we finish with drafts of the chapters.  

The second part of the book is quite different from the first. Now that many of the 'nuts and bolts' are out of the way, we can start writing some nontrivial libraries. Keep in mind you are basically alpha testing these libraries, and if you find problems, definitely feel free to report them on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/pchiusano/fpinscala-exercises/issues).

We are particularly interested in getting feedback on the effectiveness of the part 2 chapters. Part 2 is supposed to give you a window into the process of designing functional code--the goal is that you come away from part 2 in a good position to try your hand at designing your own functional libraries.

Let us know what you think!
