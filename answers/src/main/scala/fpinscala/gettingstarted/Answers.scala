  Calling `divisibleBy(0)` results in an error. But we get different
  results for these two expressions:
  
  lift(_ || _, divisibleBy(2), divisibleBy(0))
  (n: Int) => divisibleBy(2)(n) || divisibleBy(0)(n)
  
  Try them with different inputs. Why do you think one of them fails with
  an error for even numbers and the other one just returns `true` without
  failing? Do you think this has any implications for referential
  transparency? Make a note of your thoughts and revisit this question
  after reading the chapter on "strictness and laziness".

  There is a method on the `Function` object in the standard library,

  Note that we can go back and forth between the two forms. We can curry and uncurry
  and the two forms are in some sense "the same". In FP jargon, we say that they
  are _isomorphic_ ("iso" = same; "morphe" = shape, form), a term we inherit from
  category theory.
