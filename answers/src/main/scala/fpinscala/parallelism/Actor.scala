/**
 * Processes messages of type `A`, one at a time. Messages are submitted to
 * the actor with the method `!`. Processing is typically performed asynchronously,
 * this is controlled by the provided `strategy`.
 *
 * Memory consistency guarantee: when each message is processed by the `handler`, any memory that it
 * mutates is guaranteed to be visible by the `handler` when it processes the next message, even if
 * the `strategy` runs the invocations of `handler` on separate threads. This is achieved because
 * the `Actor` reads a volatile memory location before entering its event loop, and writes to the same
 * location before suspending.
 *
 * Implementation based on non-intrusive MPSC node-based queue, described by Dmitriy Vyukov:
 * [[http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/non-intrusive-mpsc-node-based-queue]]
 *
 * @see scalaz.concurrent.Promise for a use case.
 *
 * @param handler  The message handler
 * @param onError  Exception handler, called if the message handler throws any `Throwable`.
 * @param strategy Execution strategy, for example, a strategy that is backed by an `ExecutorService`
 * @tparam A       The type of messages accepted by this actor.
