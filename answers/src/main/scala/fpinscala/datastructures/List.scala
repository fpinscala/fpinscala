  buffer is allocated internal to the function, the mutation is not observable and RT is preserved.

  The other implementations build up a chain of functions which, when called, results in the operations being performed
  with the correct associativity. We are calling `foldRight` with the `B` type being instantiated to `B => B`, then
  calling the built up function with the `z` argument. Try expanding the definitions by substituting equals for equals
  using a simple example, like `foldLeft(List(1,2,3), 0)(_ + _)` if this isn't clear. Note these implementations are

  Note that we're simply referencing the `append` function, without writing something like `(x,y) => append(x,y)`

  introduced with the `def` keyword, and function values, which are the first-class objects we can pass to other
  functions, put in collections, and so on. This is a case where Scala lets us pretend the distinction doesn't exist.
