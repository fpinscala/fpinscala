/*
The implementation of `foldRight` in terms of `reverse` and `foldLeft` is a common trick for avoiding stack overflows when implementing a strict `foldRight` function as we've done in this chapter. (We'll revisit this in a later chapter, when we discuss laziness).

The other implementations build up a chain of functions which, when called, results in the operations being performed with the correct associativity. We are calling `foldRight` with the `B` type being instantiated to `B => B`, then calling the built up function with the `z` argument. Try expanding the definitions by substituting equals for equals using a simple example, like `foldLeft(List(1,2,3), 0)(_ + _)` if this isn't clear. Note these implementations are more of theoretical interest - they aren't stack-safe and won't work for large lists.

  // foldLeft processes items in the reverse order from foldRight.  It's
  // cheating to use reverse() here because that's implemented in terms of
  // foldLeft!  Instead, wrap each operation in a simple identity function to
  // delay evaluation until later and stack (nest) the functions so that the
  // order of application can be reversed.  We'll call the type of this
  // particular identity/delay function BtoB so we aren't writing B => B
  // everywhere:
  type BtoB = B => B

  // Here we declare a simple instance of BtoB according to the above
  // description.  This function will be the identity value for the inner
  // foldRight.
  def innerIdent:BtoB = (b:B) => b

  // For each item in the 'as' list (the 'a' parameter below), make a new
  // delay function which will use the combiner function (passed in above)
  // when it is evaluated later.  Each new function becomes the input to the
  // previous function (delayFunc).
  //
  //                        This much is just the type signature

  //         Paramaters                 The returned function

  // Pass the original list 'as', plus the simple identity function and the
  // new combinerDelayer to foldRight.  This will create the functions for
  // delayed evaluation with an combiner inside each one, but will not
  // apply any of those functions.
  def go:BtoB = foldRight(as, innerIdent)(combinerDelayer)

  // This forces all the evaluations to take place

Here is a sample run for further illustration purposes
foldLeftViaFoldRight_1(List(1,2,3), Nil:List[Int])((b:B, a:A) => Cons(a, b))

Becomes:
foldRight(List(1,2,3), innerIdent)(combinerDelayer)(Nil)

Becomes:
def delay3(b:B) = innerIdent(combiner(b,  3))
def delay2(b:B) = delay3(combiner(b, 2))
def delay1(b:B) = delay2(combiner(b,  1))
delay1(Nil)

Becomes:
def delay3(b:B) = innerIdent(combiner(b,  3))
def delay2(b:B) = delay3(combiner(b, 2))
delay2(combiner(Nil,  1))

Becomes:
def delay3(b:B) = innerIdent(combiner(b,  3))
delay3(combiner(combiner(Nil,  1), 2))

Becomes:
innerIdent(combiner(combiner(combiner(Nil,  1), 2),  3))

Becomes:
combiner(combiner(combiner(Nil,  1), 2),  3)

Becomes:
combiner(combiner(Cons(1,Nil), 2),  3)

Becomes:
combiner(Cons(2,Cons(1,Nil)),  3)

Becomes:
Cons(3,Cons(2,Cons(1,Nil)))
Voila!



Alternate Route:
def delay3(b:B) = innerIdent(combiner(b,  3))
def delay2(b:B) = delay3(combiner(b, 2))
def delay1(b:B) = delay2(combiner(b,  1))
delay1(Nil)

Becomes:
def delay2(b:B) = innerIdent(combiner(combiner(b, 2),  3))
def delay1(b:B) = delay2(combiner(b,  1))
delay1(Nil)

Equivalent:
def delay1(b:B) = innerIdent(combiner(combiner(combiner(b,  1), 2),  3))
delay1(Nil)

Equivalent:
((b:B) => innerIdent(combiner(combiner(combiner(b,  1), 2),  3)))(Nil)

Equivalent:
innerIdent(combiner(combiner(combiner(Nil,  1), 2),  3))
