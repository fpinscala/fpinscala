/*
Note that we're copying the entire list up until the last element. Besides being inefficient,
the natural recursive solution will use a stack frame for each element of the list, which can
lead to stack overflows for large lists (can you see why?). With lists, it's common to use a
temporary, mutable buffer internal to the function (with lazy lists or streams, which we
discuss in chapter 5, we don't normally do this). So long as the buffer is allocated internal
to the function, the mutation is not observable and RT is preserved.

Another common convention is to accumulate the output list in reverse order, then reverse it
at the end, which doesn't require even local mutation. We'll write a reverse function later
in this chapter.
