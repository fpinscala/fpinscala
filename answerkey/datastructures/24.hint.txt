It's good to specify some properties about these functions up front. For example, do you expect these expressions to be true?


```
(xs append ys) startsWith xs
xs startsWith Nil
(xs append ys append zs) hasSubsequence ys
xs hasSubsequence Nil
```

You will find that if the answer to any one of these is "yes", then that implies something about the answer to the rest of them.
