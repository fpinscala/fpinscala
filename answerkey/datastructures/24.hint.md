It's good to specify some properties about these functions up front. For example, do you expect these expressions to be true?


```
xs.append(ys).startsWith(xs)
xs.startsWith(Nil)
xs.append(ys).append(zs).hasSubsequence(ys)
xs.hasSubsequence(Nil)
```

You will find that if the answer to any one of these is "yes", then that implies something about the answer to the rest of them.
