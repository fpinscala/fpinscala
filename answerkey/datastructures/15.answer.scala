/*
Since `append` takes time proportional to its first argument, and this first argument
never grows because of the right-associativity of `foldRight`, this function is
linear in the total length of all lists. You may want to try tracing the execution of
the implementation on paper to convince yourself that this works.

Note that we're simply referencing the `append` function, without writing something
like `(x,y) => append(x,y)` or `append(_,_)`. In Scala there is a rather arbitrary
distinction between functions defined as _methods_, which are introduced with the
`def` keyword, and function values, which are the first-class objects we can pass
to other functions, put in collections, and so on. This is a case where Scala lets
us pretend the distinction doesn't exist. In other cases, you'll be forced to write
`append _` (to convert a `def` to a function value) or even
`(x: List[A], y: List[A]) => append(x,y)` if the function is polymorphic and the
type arguments aren't known.
