/* 
To match on multiple values, we can put the values into a pair and match on the pair, as shown next,
and the same syntax extends to matching on N values (see sidebar "Pairs and tuples in Scala" for
more about pair and tuple objects). You can also (somewhat less conveniently, but a bit more
efficiently) nest pattern matches: on the right hand side of the `=>`, simply begin another `match`
expression. The inner `match` will have access to all the variables introduced in the outer
`match`.

The discussion about stack usage from the explanation of `map` also applies here.
