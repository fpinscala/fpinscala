The above solution will stack overflow for large streams, since it's
not tail-recursive. Here is a tail-recursive implementation. At each
step we cons onto the front of the `acc` list, which will result in the
reverse of the stream. Then at the end we reverse the result to get the
correct order again.
[:ben] are the line breaks above okay? I'm unclear on whether these "hints" are supposed to go in the book or not

/* 
In order to avoid the `reverse` at the end, we could write it using a
mutable list buffer and an explicit loop instead. Note that the mutable
list buffer never escapes our `toList` method, so this function is
still _pure_.
