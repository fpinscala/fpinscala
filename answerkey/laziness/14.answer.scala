`s startsWith s2` when corresponding elements of `s` and `s2` are all equal, until the point that `s2` is exhausted.

Using non-strictness, we can compose these three separate logical steps--the zipping, the termination when the second stream is exhausted, and the termination if a nonmatching element is found or the first stream is exhausted.
