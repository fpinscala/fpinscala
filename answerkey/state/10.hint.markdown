Use the specialized functions for `Rand` as inspiration.

Recall that if you have a `f : S => (A,S)`, you can create a `State[S,A]` just by writing `State(f)`. The function can also be declared inline with a lambda:

```Scala
State { (s: S) => 
  ... 
  (a,s2) 
}
// or
State ((s: S) => { 
  ... 
  (a,s2) 
})
```

We usually use the first form just to avoid an extra level of parentheses and braces.
