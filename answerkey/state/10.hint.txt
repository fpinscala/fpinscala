Use the specialized functions for `Rand` as inspiration.

For a function `foo` in our class State, you can lift a lambda
that takes an `s:S` and returns a tuple `(a2:A,s2:S)` using the
following syntax:

```
def foo[B](f: A => State[S, B]): State[S, B] =
    State(s => {
      ...
      ...
      (a2,s2)
    })
```
