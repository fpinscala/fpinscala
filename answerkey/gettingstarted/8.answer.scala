/*
There is a method on the `Function` object in the standard library,
`Function.uncurried` that you can use for uncurrying.

Note that we can go back and forth between the two forms. We can curry and uncurry
and the two forms are in some sense "the same". In FP jargon, we say that they
are _isomorphic_ ("iso" = same; "morphe" = shape, form), a term we inherit from
category theory.
