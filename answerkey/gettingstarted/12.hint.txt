The regular recursive definition follows more or less directly from the description of the Fibonacci sequence. The tail-recursive definition is a lot harder, and requires some thinking. You will definitely need a helper method like we did with `factorial`. But think about what information you need at each iteration. You might need two accumulators, one for each of the two numbers you need to calculate the next number. And you know the first two numbers already.
